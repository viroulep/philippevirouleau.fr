<h2>(Separate) compilation</h2>

<p>
Compilation is the translation of a source code file to a binary file, it can implicitly contain a linking step in order to create an executable program.

When we have more than one source file, it's usual to compile separately each file (.cpp) into an object file (.o), and then do a separate linking step to create the executable (MyUnicorn).
